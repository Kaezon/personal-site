I've finally gotten around to creating a new section of my site for Javascript experiments.
There's no real consistent theme or intent to these except to serve as a place where I can have some fun and share the results.

To this end, I also decided to expose the code for each post so that visitors don't need to inspect the page to get at it.
My friend reccomended [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) to get syntax highlighting on the page and It's worked out quite well. Simply by adding two stylesheets and a script, anything inside of `<pre><code>` tags will be styled automatically. The one caveat being that the language you want to highlight might require an extra script import.

I've started the collection with a simple PixiJS experiment. I'm not really sure what I'll do next, but I am excited to publish more ðŸ˜€
