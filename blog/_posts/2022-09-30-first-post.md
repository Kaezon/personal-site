Here it is! My first blog post.
This honestly isn't something I ever saw myself doing, but making my own space to speak my mind has felt more and more important lately. Besides that, I haven't made a web page since the 90's and it felt like a good challenge.
So far, I've had a lot of fun putting this together using Jekyl. I'll admit up front that I dug through some template sites to figure out what I wanted the layout to look like, but I did hack together the CSS on my own :P

I feel like the layout and design still needs more work, but maybe that's just normal. It'd also be fun to knock the rust off of my limited JS skills and play with stuff like PixiJS.

I'm not really sure where this project will go, but I'm exited to be part of a modest community where I can participate in some experimentation. Maybe I can even contribute a little bit of good to the web!
